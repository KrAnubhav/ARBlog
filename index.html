            <h3 class="blog-post-title">Good ways to learn web development</h3>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 2021 by <b>Anubhav Rai</b> </p>
    
            <p> The internet is always growing, and is reaching more and more locations. Consequently, developing webpages is probably one of the 
              most important fields in all of the IT world. Udemy allows students to learn the skills necessary to become web developers, 
              and gives experienced web developers the chance to learn new skills as well as hone their current ones.</p>
             <hr>
           <p>Web development is a multi-discipline process. It involves two different aspects of software development. 
             The front end designing part and the backend development part. Both parts have their own field. Known as the front end development and
              the other known as the backend development. But since you didn’t mention the one you want to learn, I shall try to explain the process of 
              learning both or learning full-stack development. TO be a full stack developer, you must first learn the most basic of Web language, HTML. 
              Along with HTML, you should learn CSS and basic JavaScript. JavaScript might come in handy in backend development as well depending on your
               choice of language. But its primary use is in Frontend. You will also have to learn some frameworks such as Bootstraps, JQuery, etc. Once you have completed these, 
               you should focus on programming the backend. If you have prior experience in any programming language, I suggest you at first try to find out if there is a backend development framework of option available in that language. If not, there are options such as PHP, Python, JavaScript, C#, etc. for web development. Some of them such as PHP and JavaScript can be used to write raw web codes, whereas the others need to rely on a framework. 
             Your choice should depend on some factors such as your location, your expertise, and knowledge in prior languages, etc.</p>

            <h3>Front-End</h3>
            <p>Front End web development takes care of the looks, interfaces, animations of the website.</p>
            <p>HTML and CSS is the most fundamental and basic thing that you must and must know! HTML and CSS, however, are pretty easy to learn as they don’t involve much programming. And since those are scripting language and don’t even involve logic so they are pretty easy.

              When you’ll be able to do things in CSS3 you will see that you already can do a lot of stuff and that is amazing, right? Here is one of the best courses that I recommend I myself took it!This is the most fundamental and basic thing that you must and must know! HTML and CSS, however, are pretty easy to learn as they don’t involve much programming. And since those are scripting language and don’t even involve logic so they are pretty easy.

              When you’ll be able to do things in CSS3 you will see that you already can do a lot of stuff and that is amazing, right? Here is one of the best courses that I recommend I myself took it!</p>
            <li>You should learn HTML and CSS as the base of layout development.</li>
            <li>Later you should proceed for Bootstrap, which is a framework for CSS. With the languages mentioned till now, you can develop a cool static webpage.</li>
            <li>To build dynamic webpages, you should learn JavaScript. Once you learn JavaScript, it will be easier for you to grasp the concepts of jQuery, which is a JavaScript framework. Jquery will help you apply JavaScript concepts smoothly and easily. You will certainly fall in love with jQuery.</li>
            <li>(Optional) To make your page more attractive and glossy, you may wish to learn animations. So you can opt to learn SVG and Canvas. </li>
            
            <p>Never Understimate the power of practice that why practice as much you can , in the starting phase of learning you face many of problems but remember this is your time and you need to work hard as much you can. </p>
           
            <h3>Back-End</h3>
             <p>Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information.</p>
             <li>Back end Development refers to the server-side development</li>
             <li>Back end developer skills include Development Languages, Database and cache, Server, API (REST & SOAP), etc.</li>
             <li>The backend web developer should understand the goals of the website and come up with effective solutions</li>
             <li>The languages that a front-end developer should be familiar with are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript whereas Back End web developer should be familiar with the database, Server, API, etc.</li>
             <li>Working experience of frameworks like Django for Python, Larval for PHP, etc</li>
             <li>Backend engineer should know at least one server-side or Backend programming language like Java, Python, Ruby, . Net etc.</li>
            
             <p>After doing all that you become a full stack developer, One thing always remember that "Life is a journy here is no station, no destination keep learning and enojoy your journy.</p>
